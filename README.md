# Weather-App-SOA
This is a weather application developed using a Service Oriented Architecture.
We have an API providing the weather data in SpringBoot
Another API that consumes this API developed in NodeJS
And at the end, an interface developed in Angular to show the results.

My name is Sidy TRAORE, a Senegalese software engineer.
